// Problem Description

// Rishik likes candies a lot. So, he went to a candy-shop to buy candies.

// The shopkeeper showed him N packets each containg A[i] candies for cost of C[i] nibbles, each candy in that packet has a sweetness B[i]. The shopkeeper puts the condition that Rishik can buy as many complete candy-packets as he wants but he can't buy a part of the packet.

// Rishik has D nibbles, can you tell him the maximum amount of sweetness he can get from candy-packets he will buy?


// Problem Constraints

// 1 <= N <= 700

// 1 <= A[i] <= 1000

// 1 <= B[i] <= 1000

// 1 <= C[i],D <= 1000



// Input Format

// First argument of input is an integer array A
// Second argument of input is an integer array B
// Third argument of input is an integer array C
// Fourth argument of input is an integer D


// Output Format

// Return a single integer denoting maximum sweetness of the candies that he can buy


// Example Input

// Input 1:

//  A = [1, 2, 3]
//  B = [2, 2, 10]
//  C = [2, 3, 9]
//  D = 8
// Input 2:

//  A = [2]
//  B = [5]
//  C = [10]
//  D = 99


// Example Output

// Output 1:

//  10
// Output 2:

//  90


// Example Explanation

// Explanation 1:

//  Choose 1 Packet of kind 1 = 1 Candy of 2 Sweetness = 2 Sweetness
//  Choose 2 Packet of kind 2 = 2 Candy of 2 Sweetness = 8 Sweetness
// Explanation 2:

//  Buy 9 Packet of kind 1. 18 Candy each of 5 Sweetness = 90 Sweetness
