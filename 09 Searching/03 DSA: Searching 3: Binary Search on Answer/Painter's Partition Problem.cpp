// Problem Description

// Given 2 integers A and B and an array of integers C of size N. Element C[i] represents the length of ith board.
// You have to paint all N boards [C0, C1, C2, C3 â€¦ CN-1]. There are A painters available and each of them takes B units of time to paint 1 unit of the board.

// Calculate and return the minimum time required to paint all boards under the constraints that any painter will only paint contiguous sections of the board.
// NOTE:
// 1. 2 painters cannot share a board to paint. That is to say, a board cannot be painted partially by one painter, and partially by another.
// 2. A painter will only paint contiguous boards. This means a configuration where painter 1 paints boards 1 and 3 but not 2 is invalid.

// Return the ans % 10000003.



// Problem Constraints

// 1 <= A <= 1000
// 1 <= B <= 106
// 1 <= N <= 105
// 1 <= C[i] <= 106



// Input Format

// The first argument given is the integer A.
// The second argument given is the integer B.
// The third argument given is the integer array C.



// Output Format

// Return minimum time required to paint all boards under the constraints that any painter will only paint contiguous sections of board % 10000003.



// Example Input

// Input 1:

//  A = 2
//  B = 5
//  C = [1, 10]
// Input 2:

//  A = 10
//  B = 1
//  C = [1, 8, 11, 3]


// Example Output

// Output 1:

//  50
// Output 2:

//  11


// Example Explanation

// Explanation 1:

//  Possibility 1:- One painter paints both blocks, time taken = 55 units.
//  Possibility 2:- Painter 1 paints block 1, painter 2 paints block 2, time take = max(5, 50) = 50
//  There are no other distinct ways to paint boards.
//  ans = 50 % 10000003
// Explanation 2:

//  Each block is painted by a painter so, Painter 1 paints block 1, painter 2 paints block 2, painter 3 paints block 3 
//  and painter 4 paints block 4, time taken = max(1, 8, 11, 3) = 11
//  ans = 11 % 10000003
