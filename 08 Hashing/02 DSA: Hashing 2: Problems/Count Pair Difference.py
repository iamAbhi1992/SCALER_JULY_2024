# Problem Description

# You are given an array A of N integers and an integer B.
# Count the number of pairs (i,j) such that A[i] - A[j] = B and i â‰  j.

# Since the answer can be very large, return the remainder after dividing the count with 109+7.


# Problem Constraints

# 1 <= N <= 105
# 1 <= A[i] <= 109
# 1 <= B <= 109


# Input Format

# First argument A is an array of integers and second argument B is an integer.


# Output Format

# Return an integer.


# Example Input

# Input 1:

# A = [3, 5, 1, 2]
# B = 4
# Input 2:

# A = [1, 2, 1, 2]
# B = 1


# Example Output

# Output 1:

# 1
# Output 2:

# 4


# Example Explanation

# Example 1:

# The only pair is (2, 3) which gives difference as 4
# Example 2:

# The pair which gives difference as 3 are (2, 1), (4, 1), (2, 3) and (4, 3).

    # @param A : list of integers
    # @param B : integer
    # @return an integer
    def solve(self, A, B):
        mod = int(1e9 + 7)  # Ensure mod is an integer
        count = 0
        diff_map = {}

        for num in A:
            # Check for (num - B)
            if (num - B) in diff_map:
                count += diff_map[num - B]

            # Check for (num + B)
            if (num + B) in diff_map:
                count += diff_map[num + B]

            # Update the frequency map for the current num
            if num in diff_map:
                diff_map[num] += 1
            else:
                diff_map[num] = 1

        return count % mod
