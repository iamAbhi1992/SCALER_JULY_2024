# Problem Description

# You are given an array A of N integers and an integer B. Count the number of pairs (i,j) such that A[i] + A[j] = B and i â‰  j.

# Since the answer can be very large, return the remainder after dividing the count with 109+7.

# Note - The pair (i,j) is same as the pair (j,i) and we need to count it only once.


# Problem Constraints

# 1 <= N <= 105
# 1 <= A[i] <= 109
# 1 <= B <= 109


# Input Format

# First argument A is an array of integers and second argument B is an integer.


# Output Format

# Return an integer.


# Example Input

# Input 1:

# A = [3, 5, 1, 2]
# B = 8
# Input 2:

# A = [1, 2, 1, 2]
# B = 3


# Example Output

# Output 1:

# 1
# Output 2:

# 4


# Example Explanation

# Example 1:

# The only pair is (1, 2) which gives sum 8
# Example 2:

# The pair which gives sum as 3 are (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 3) and (3, 4).

class Solution:
    # @param A : list of integers
    # @param B : integer
    # @return an integer
    def solve(self, A, B):
        mod=int(1e9+7)
        count=0

        freq_map={}

        for num in A:
            if (B-num) in freq_map:
                count+=freq_map[B-num]

            if num not in freq_map:
                freq_map[num]=1
            else:
                freq_map[num]+=1

        return count%mod
